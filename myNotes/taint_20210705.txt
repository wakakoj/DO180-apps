You have one project on this server: "schedule-pods-ts"

Using project "schedule-pods-ts".
[student@workstation ~]$ oc new-project schedul-pods
Now using project "schedul-pods" on server "https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app ruby~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

[student@workstation ~]$ oc new-app --name hello --docker-image quay.io/redhattraining/hello-world-nginx:v1.0
--> Found container image 44eaa13 (2 years old) from quay.io for "quay.io/redhattraining/hello-world-nginx:v1.0"

    Red Hat Universal Base Image 8 
    ------------------------------ 
    The Universal Base Image is designed and engineered to be the base layer for all of your containerized applications, middleware and utilities. This base image is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat and updated regularly.

    Tags: base rhel8

    * An image stream tag will be created as "hello:v1.0" that will track this image

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "hello" created
    deployment.apps "hello" created
    service "hello" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/hello' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
